TrinityLabs Mendelmax 1.5+ Community Documentation Project	


This is the start of a good up to date documentation for building a TrinityLabs
Mendelmax 1.5+ with the new updated Y axis and other assorted sundries.


It is being released in true open source style... unfinished and unpolished ;)

We are soliciting feedback, input, additions, edits, photos etc so we can make this a living document abouthow to build the most up to date version of the TrinityLabs MendelMax.

Please help, YEAH THIS MEANS YOU!!!
